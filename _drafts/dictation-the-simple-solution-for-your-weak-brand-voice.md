Brand voice is a business’s style of communication. It’s what makes a brand unique or gives it personality. It’s what makes a silk-stocking law firm's communication different than that of a bungie jumping company. Brand voice often comes naturally for small businesses with a vision that is understood by the few employees. In mid-size and large companies, however, brand voice becomes more difficult to maintain. Don’t believe me? Ask five different people at a large company what the company does. If you hear the same answer in five different ways, the company likely has a weak brand voice. Luckily, there is a simple marketing solution.

## How Brand Voices Are Typically Developed

Content Marketing Institute has written an informative [article on defining a companies brand voice](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/10/define-brand-voice/). Any marketers looking to build their company's brand voice should consider this as a starting point. A high level summary of this process is as follows:

1. Describe the brand in three words (i.e. Passionate, Quirky, and Authentic)
2. Create a brand voice chart (see below)
3. Have writers understand and put the voice into action
4. Revisit the chart as company's voice changes over time
