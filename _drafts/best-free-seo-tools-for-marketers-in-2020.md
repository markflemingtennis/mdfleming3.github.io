In my [ELI5 Guide to SEO](https://markdfleming.com/eli5-guide-search-engine-optimization-seo/ "ELI5 Guide to SEO"), I discussed the factors that are important to a businesses on-page and off-page performance. MarTech companies are constantly pitching software that can improve these tools to small businesses. While many of these tools are excellent, there are hundreds of powerful FREE tools on the internet that can optimize your SEO performance. I will highlight the tools that I feel are your best resource in 2020.

## On-Page SEO

### [Woorank](https://www.woorank.com/ "Woorank")

Woorank is an analysis tool that provides simple and easy to interpret analysis of your on-page SEO data. If you are looking for a macro view of your website's performance, I feel this is the definitive tool.

### [Browseo](https://www.browseo.net/ "Browseo")

Browseo is a no-frills program that shows you what data a search engine is collecting from a webpage. It is an excellent tool for competitive research and troubleshooting SEO for individual pages.

## Analytics

### [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/ "Google Analytics")

Google's flagship website tool that tracks everything you need to know. This is an essential tool. If you do not have this hooked up, you are not only missing out on valuable data, your SEO is likely penalized.

### [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about "Google Search Console")

Google Search Console allows webmasters to measure search traffic and performance, fix issues, and optimize indexing for webpages. Since this data directly impacts your search engine rank, this is another essential tool from Google.

### [SpyFu](https://www.spyfu.com/)

SpyFu is a competitive analysis that allows you to search for competitors websites, see their traffic, and download their keywords. This can quickly help you spy on competitors PPC strategy and SEO tactics.

### [SEOlyzer](https://seolyzer.io/ "SEOlyzer")

SEOlyzer is a tool that allows you to visualize and analyze log analysis and monitor SEO KPIs in real time.

## Keyword Research:

### [Moz Keyword Explorer](https://moz.com/explorer "Moz Keyword Explorer")

Moz's Keyword Explorer allows users to explore search engine results by keywords. This allows you to see what pages are ranking for a set keyword and if it is possible for your website to even have a chance at ranking. Additionally, this Swiss Army knife of a tool allows for top notch keyword and link research.

### [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/ "Ubersuggest")

Ubersuggest provides a traffic analyzer, SEO analyzer, and keywords/content idea generator tool. This makes the destination a great one-stop destination for keyword research and competitive analysis.

### [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/ "Google Keyword Planner")

This tool is typically used for keyword research when running PPC campaigns, but it can be hugely useful for content writers looking for long-string keywords. Search for a keyword idea, and you will receive a list of related keywords with average monthly searches and level of competition. This can all be easily exported.

### [Ahrefs Keyword Generator](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator "Ahrefs Keyword Generator")

Similar to Google Keyword Planner, this tool outputs keyword search volume. Why this tool is essential is that you can segment keywords by Google, Bing, YouTube, and Amazon.

### [Answer the Public](https://answerthepublic.com/ "Answer the Public")

In my article, "[The S.M.A.R.T Way to Find Content Ideas for Your Blog](https://markdfleming.com/the-smart-way-to-find-content-ideas-for-your-blog/ "The S.M.A.R.T Way to Find Content Ideas for Your Blog")," I discuss the power of paying attention to Google's fill-in feature. Answer the Public is like Google's fill-in feature on steroids. It visualizes consumers searches in a way that makes creating headings and blog posts a breeze.

### [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/ "Google Trends")

Curious about what's trending? Google Trends provides visualizations of Google Search volume over time. While not as targeted as some of the keyword planner platforms, I think this is an essential tool for looking at the big picture when creating content.

## Links

### [Ahrefs Backlink Checker](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker "Ahrefs Backlink Checker")

Backlinks are a very important part of SEO; the quality and quantity of links directed to your site is the fastest way to increase your domain authority. Along with Google Search Console, the best tool for checking these links is the Ahref Backlink Checker.
