Influencer marketing is expected to become a nearly $10 billion market this year with companies increasing influencer spends and creators coming of age. Despite this growth, many small businesses do not have effective practices in place for vetting influencers. This results in both companies and customers being fooled by creators that are not as popular as they may seem. For example, a study by CBS News claims that 15% of corporate dollars spent on influencer marketing is lost to targeting fake followers. To avoid such fraud, I have assembled metrics you should consider to determine the authenticity of an Instagram influencer.

## Abnormal Historical Growth and Engagement

[Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/ "Social Blade") is my favorite FREE tool for determining if an influencer is legitimate. I will use it for all analysis done in this article. Its most powerful feature is its ability to see historical insights from a social media account. As compared to seeing a simple metric like engagement rate, this digs deeper into the historical growth of an influencer's account. You can correlate spikes in growth with certain actions. Let's look at [Roger Federer's](http://instagram.com/rogerfederer "Roger Federer Instagram") account.

Federer's account is consistently growing, and his weekly growth is always positive with occasional jumps in account growth. Since there are no abnormalities in this traffic, this is a portrait of a legitimate account. This makes sense because Federer is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.

On the other hand, let's look at an account with abnormal traffic.

Firstly, these statistics are from a verified Instagram account with over 600,000 followers at the time of this post. It appears to be affiliated with one of the largest influencer marketing agencies in the world. In the total follower traffic, this account appears to be losing 5,000 followers per week. In the second graphic, this account appears to have gained over 280,000 followers in the week of June 10, 2019. Given that the account only gain 600 followers the week before and lost over 8,000 two weeks after, something fishy is going on here.

## Declining Momentum

Many influencers run paid advertisements to increase their total followings and overall engagement rates. The fact that influencers are running paid campaigns should not be a dealbreaker for the company; it's a common and healthy practice for growing followers. However, this becomes a problem when paid campaigns are the only drivers of account growth, where engagement ends when paid campaigns end. By analyzing historical growth, companies can see patterns in the traffic and avoid influencers who are in periods of declining momentum.

In the example above, the account goes through cycles of high growth and negative growth. Before collaborating with such an influencer, a company will want to understand what is causing the cyclical nature of growth. If the growth driver is simply paid campaigns, the company may be better off paying for ads than paying an influencer.

## Low Comment Quality

While Instagram comment sections are not exactly Shakespeare, extremely low comment quality may indicate that engagers are only bots or low-engagement users. Let's consider an example where none of the comments have anything to do with the post.

High quality influencers' posts typically have substantial dialogue. Influencers who have low quality comments likely have low quality engagement that will not convert to sales.

## Follow/Unfollow Method

On Instagram, there is a curtesy where you generally follow individuals who follow you. For some of the largest accounts, the follower/following ratio is disproportionate, which may mislead users to think an account is hugely influential. In actuality, its pretty easy to gain followers using the Follow/Unfollow Method.

This method is where you follow a large number of users, either manually or through automation. A certain percentage of these users will follow you back (likely because they are active in the [#followforfollowback](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/followforfollowback/ "#followforfollowback") community). Once a user has accumulated a large following, they will unfollow all the individuals that initially followed them. This gives the impression they are very popular.

While this method can give high engagement, its problem is many of the followers are not genuinely interested in the influencer. They were only interested in growing their own following, and they will likely hurt your conversion rate.

## Inconsistency Across Platforms

Kylie Jenner is one of Instagrams biggest influencers as she approaches nearly 200 million followers at the time of this article. Many outlets frequently beg the question of how many of these followers are real vs. bots, dead accounts, unengaged followers, etc. It's a fair question that is very hard to answer.

An easy way to survey this traffic is by comparing traffic across social media platforms. For Kylie Jenner, she has many millions of followers across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. Even if she has several million fake followers, her influence is immense.

This may not be the case for mid size and micro influencers. Before hiring an influencer, companies must audit all of an influencers accounts. Disproportionate followings for a single account may be a red flag.

## Be Careful with Engagement Rate

High and low engagement rates are not a tell-tale measurement of good influencer vs. a bad influencer. My Instagram is modest with only several dozen followers, yet it has an engagement rate that is many times the size of Roger Federer and Kylie Jenner. Does that mean companies should hire me over them? No. It means there are other considerations in play. 

Engagement can be skewed high and low by factors like follower size, post frequency, and hashtag usage. As so, influencers with low engagement should not necessarily be removed from consideration. Rather, you should try to understand why engagement is high or low. 

## Key Takeaways

In analyzing influencers, marketers need to determine if an influencer will be a good fit for their brand. To determine this, companies should consider content, transparency, but most importantly why the influencer is influential. Does shady metrics in the past provide clues? Are they increasing in popularity? Have they engaged in low quality approaches to gain followers? These are all crucial questions to ask. The best influencers will pass all of these with flying colors. Those are creators a company should target as partners.
