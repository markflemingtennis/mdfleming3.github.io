In this “Explain like I am Five” (ELI5) Guide, I will explain everything you need to know to build the foundations of a good email marketing strategy.

## What is Email Marketing?

Email marketing is the act of sending automated or mass distributed email content to customers and/or clients who have chosen to opt-in to receiving content directly from the company. In comparison to other forms of digital marketing, email is useful because it is:

* **Direct** - It is frequently more engaged with than other forms of marketing
* **Automated** - it can replace the efforts of salespeople
* **Affordable** - email is one of the cheapest way to send customized messages to thousands of contacts
* **Data-driving** - email is a behemoth for collecting customer data; many companies are building new business simply through email automation

## What are the stages of Email Marketing?

Every company’s email marketing can be segmented into five types of actions. Don’t think these actions as chronological but rather cogs that are running at the same time.

* Collect Data:
* Manage Data
* Send Content
* Drive Action
* Measure Results

We will dig into each of these stages.
