Brand voice is a business’s style of communication. It’s what makes a brand unique or gives it personality. It’s what makes a silk-stocking law firm's communication different than that of a bungie jumping company. Brand voice often comes naturally for small businesses with a vision that is understood by the few employees. In mid-size and large companies, however, brand voice becomes more difficult to maintain. Don’t believe me? Ask five different people at a large company what the company does. If you hear the same answer in five different ways, the company likely has a weak brand voice. Luckily, there is a simple marketing solution.

## How Brand Voices Are Typically Developed

Brand voice is defined as a company's style of communication. It's the non-human voice that shows customers how this company is different. It's the company's persona. 

Content Marketing Institute has written an informative [article on defining a companies brand voice](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/10/define-brand-voice/). Any marketer looking to build their company's brand voice should consider this as a starting point. A high level summary of this process is as follows:

1. Describe the brand in three words (i.e. Passionate, Quirky, and Authentic)
2. Create a brand voice chart (see below)
3. Have writers put the voice into action using this chart
4. Revisit the chart as company's voice changes over time

## The Problem of Authenticity

While the framework above is excellent for setting goals for a company's brand voice design, it doesn't provide any insight into actually how to create the voice. Is a writer supposed to take creative liberty under this framework? Should we reuse successful pieces of content to make a brand voice Frankenstein? Should we throw something against the wall and revise until analytics show something that is working?

The biggest problem with building a brand voice is the "problem of authenticity." This is where a marketing team or consultant creates a brand voice that is inconsistent with how a business speaks with clients. To test if your company has a problem of authenticity, ask several different leaders what the company does and what it values. If you're hearing different responses, the company's brand voice is going to be unclear.

To build a strong brand voice, writers need to understand the story of a company. Every story is composed of characters. These characters overcome challenges. Who are the main characters at your company? What problems has the company solved? Why are these triumphs important? And most importantly for brand voice, how do these individuals at your firm answer these questions? Their tone, keywords, characteristic -- those will give you everything you need to create an authentic brand.
