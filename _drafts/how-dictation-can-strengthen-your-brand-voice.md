Brand voice is a business’s style of communication. It’s what makes a brand unique or gives it personality. It’s what makes a silk-stocking law firm's communication different than that of a bungie jumping company.

3. Have writers put the voice into action using this chart
4. Revisit the chart as company's voice changes over time

Should we throw something against the wall and revise until analytics show something that is working?

The process of designing a brand voice needs to consider the story of the company. Ask yourself who are the people within your company that make it what it is today? For a small 

Many companies use it to identify their brand voice before employing a writer to create content under these loose guidelines. While this may result it great content, it does not address the problem of authenticity. 

The problem of authenticity is that content writers are only a single perspective within a company. Whether it's noticeable of not, a writer's voice takes on his or her own voice. This can become problematic, because every key player in a company has such a voice. The leaders speak a certain way. The salespeople speak another way. The product builder speak...you guessed it...in their own way. A strong brand has the ability to tie in all of these languages into a powerful

While this may result in great content, the process does not address the issue that brand voice flows throughout an organization. Simply 

However, it does little for actually creating an authentic voice. That is, having a team of writers come up with buzz words and 

 of designing your brand voice, but the actual content creation stage of building a brand voice simply relies on a writer hammering out content you can use for landing pages, campaigns, etc.
