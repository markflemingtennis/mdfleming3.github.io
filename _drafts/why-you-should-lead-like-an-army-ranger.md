After two long year of schoolwork, I recently completed my MBA just before the holidays. With all my new spare time, I have been reading a lot lately. As a carry-over from my studies, I have been particularly interested in marketing leadership. I’ve had the chance to read several works from across disciplines. While many of these works are filled with compelling insights, I found that one of these works painted a portrait of a leader far better than the rest. What’s that work? _The Army Ranger Handbook_.

In the first chapter of the handbook, leadership is defined as the most essential element of a mission. To be an effective leader, one must follow the Be, Know, and Do principles. Below is a summary of these principles:

## Principle #1: Be

* Be technically proficient
* Be courageous, committed, and candid
* Be a leader with integrity

## Principle #2: Know

* Know yourself, your character, your skills
* Know your strengths and weaknesses
* Seek continual improvement and work to overcome your weaknesses
* Know your team
* Train your team for the rigors of day to day operations
* Take care of your team’s needs
* Discipline and reward your team, as needed

## Principle #3: Do

* Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions
* Exercise initiative
* Demonstrate resourcefulness
* Take advantage of opportunities that will lead to victory
* Accept fair criticism
* Correct your mistakes
* Assess situations rapidly
* Make sound and timely decisions
* Gather essential information
* Announce decisions in time for your team to react
* Consider long and short term effects of your decision
* Set high but attainable standards for your team
* Be willing to do what you require of your team
* Share hardships with your team
* Keep subordinates informed and help them make decisions within your intent
* Encourage initiative
* Improve teamwork
* Enhance morale
* Delegate work to subordinates to show you trust them
* Ensure team understands task
* Supervise your team to ensure subordinates accomplish tasks
* Cross-train team until they are confident in their technical capabilities

## Takeaways

So, why should you lead like an Army Ranger? The principles that make a successful Army Ranger leader translate to the business world. If you think of the bosses, teachers, or coaches that you inspired you the most – they likely embodied several of these qualities. On the other hand, when you think of your worst past superiors, they most likely lacked some of these skills. Right?

While I don’t think there is any leader that perfectly embodies all of these qualities, I think this is a model that all leaders should pursue. For me, this blog post is about reminding myself in 20 days, 20 months, or even 20 years of what I should strive for. I wish you the best of luck in doing so too.
