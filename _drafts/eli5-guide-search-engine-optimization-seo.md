Search engine optimization – yes, that fancy phrase you’ve heard for years. You know it’s important, but do you really know how it works for your website and Google Search engine success? In this ELI5 guide (ELI5 = “Explain like I am 5”), I will explain everything you need to know to get started with SEO. My goal is for this guide to be a practical reference to help you better understand the jargon and marketing concepts used in this blog.

## What is SEO?

SEO is short for “search engine optimization.” This is a fancy word for the process of improving your webpage’s position on search results. With millions of results for every search engine query, SEO helps your page rank correctly and higher than your competitors. Unlike Search Engine Marketing campaigns (SEM) that involve managing paid advertisements, SEO is an “organic” or an unpaid process. This means that you cannot pay for a higher position; it is determined by playing by the search engine’s rules.

## Why are search engine rankings important?

Simply put, high position pages get a lot of more traffic than low position pages. More traffic = more sales and visibility.

To better understand the decay that occurs from high position pages to low position pages, let’s consider some research. In analyzing over 5 million SERPs, a Backlinko study found that:

* Top position results gets 31.7% of all clicks
* Top three position results get 75.1% of all clicks
* Second page results get only 0.78% of all clicks (Yikes!)

In another study, Ignite Visibility found that clickthrough rates (CTR) dramatically decreased depending on where a webpage was positioned.

* Position 1: 43.32%
* Position 2: 37.36%
* Position 3: 29.90%
* Position 4: 19.38%
* Position 5: 10.95%
* Position 6: 10%
* Position 7: 5.28%
* Position 8: 4.13%
* Position 9: 4.13%
* Position 10: 3.11%

In short, good search engine rankings have a huge impact on traffic! By understanding how these are calculated, you can have an upper hand on your competitors.

## On-page SEO and Off-page SEO

Now that we know what SEO is and why it’s important, you may be wondering: what factors influence SEO? Let’s lift the hood and look around.

SEO is separated into two buckets: On-page SEO and Off-Page SEO. On page-SEO consists of factors that occur _within your website’s code_. You have lots of control over these factors, and optimizing these factors will improve how users experience your website. On the other hand, Off-page SEO occurs _outside your website’s code_, where you have less control. This balance of highly controlled on-page SEO factors and uncontrolled off-page SEO factors check and balance one another. If your strategy does not consider both of these categories, your website will not earn a top position for highly accessed keywords.

## On Page SEO Checklist:

### Content Factors

As discussed in the previous section, on page SEO is what you control. With a website, you have the greatest control over your content. As so, content factors are some of the most important SEO factors for distinguishing yourself from your competitors and getting searchers to actually click on your page.

#### Title Tag

A title tag is the title of the page. It should hook users to the page, but it must be _unique_ and _descriptive_ of the page contents. Here are some key considerations:

* **Keywords:** By including the keyword that your article is about will help the search engine figure out what the page is about. For example, “20 Best Men’s Shoes for Hiking in 2020” gives a very good idea of what an article will be about.
* **Ideal length:** 50-60 characters. If a webpage is longer, Google will cut off the article (i.e. “List of Disney theatrical animated features | Disney Wiki ...”).
* **Branding:** Many websites include branding at the end of their title tag. This helps improve your branding, but it also helps rank the page for search queries related to your brand.

#### Meta Description

A meta description is the description of the page. Think of this as a description of your page in one sentence. Here are some key considerations:

* **Keywords:** Like title tags, strategically use the keywords you want to target here, but also make sure they appear within the body of the page.
* **Ideal Length:** 150-300 characters. Any shorter, you're missing out on keyword opportunities. Any longer, the search engine will cut you off.

#### Heading tags

In a website, there are typically 6 levels of HTML heading tags that are used on a webpage (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>).  While h1 is typically reserved for the title of the page, the rest are used for subheadings that helps the search engine organize content.

* Use these heading tags to break content into sections, and use the headings as an opportunity to further embed keywords. If you scan this page, you will see that I am using a wide range of headings to nest subtopics within topics.

#### Good Content

Any SEO guide will recommend writing good content as the #1 priority for a website. I agree. But what exactly makes "good content" for SEO? At its core, this is writing content that users want to keep reading. That should be your goal first.

After that, you should consider keyword planning. Keyword planning is not stuffing hundred of the same word into your article. Search engines have discouraged that since the early 2000s. Rather, keyword planning involves using a tool like [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/ "Google Keyword Planner") to identify keywords and keyword phrases with high traffic and low competition. By integrating these into your text in a user-friendly manner, users can discover better content and your website can earn a high position.

Here are a few overarching concepts:

* Writing quality: Employ proper grammar, punctuation, etc. Also, apply good style that can be understood by as many audiences as possible.
* Ideal Article Length: Recommendations vary on this, but most recommendations are between 500-2,000 words, with 1,600 words being the sweet spot.

#### Image Alt Text

Alt Text is what appears when an image fails to load. While a web developer intend for these to be used with screen readers worst case scenario, search engines use these for indexing images within a search engine. If you fail to include alt text with images in your website, this will hurt your search engine position. If you include alt-text and ensure it's relevant to your content, this can help you

#### URL Structure

URLs are easy to understand are much better than URLs that are not. If your URL has a lot of numbers or strings of text you do not understand, that is not good. Google prefers URLs that are simple and contain relevant information to what people are searching. Here is an ideal example:

    https://www.example.com/category-keyword/subcategory-keyword/primary-keyword

#### Internal Links

You'll notice that nearly all websites have a menu bar that exists at the top of a webpage that links to a variety of categories and subpages and internal links. This is important because it:

1. Improves user experience
2. Helps search engines develop and internal hierarchy of the website

By having an experienced web developer or a well-developed template, this should be included on all websites. Poor structure will be detrimental to a new blog.

#### Broken Links

A broken link occurs when a URL has been removed or a page is not working correctly. Generally this creates a 404 error, which means a page cannot be found. This is bad for a user experience and bad for SEO. As so all website owners should ensure that their website is free of bad links by using a tool like [Dead Link Checker](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/ "Dead Link Checker").

### Indexing

Once I had a boss notice a webpage was still appearing on Google that shouldn’t be. The boss said, “Give those folks at Google a call and tell them to take that page down this instant.” I said, “Uh, that’s not how it works.” The boss said, “Well, how does it work?”

#### Sitemap and robots.txt

In a nutshell, there are two files that websites must have to interact with search engines. The first is a robots.txt file. This tells the search engine if it can “crawl” the website for content. Without this little file, you will not appear on a Google or Bing. If you have a sensitive page within a website, robots.txt files can prevent these pages from being accessed.

The second page that is essential is a sitemap. This page expands on the robots.txt file. Its job is to inform search engine crawlers of new content that is added. This is how your new pages appear on Google.

### Mobile

#### Mobile Friendliness

At the time this article was published, over 50% of internet users are using mobile phones. Those numbers are consistent with the traffic I have noticed with this website. Google’s algorithm gives preference to websites that have mobile-friendly websites. To test if your website is mobile friendly, use \[Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test\]( [https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly "https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly"))

* Readability:
* Mobile Viewport:

### Structured Data

#### Schema Markup

Schema markup is code that can help search engines understand your content in ways that metadata and title tags cannot. This markup, which is typically added to the <head> section of your code, helps add additional information such as ratings, events, person information, social media, and other applicable content to a blog. See the examples below. To create this markup code, check out a tool like [Technical SEO's Markup Generator]().
