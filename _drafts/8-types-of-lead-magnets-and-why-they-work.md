A lead magnet is an incentive given to potential customers for providing contact information, such as name and email, through a company's website. This exchange works because both the company and the consumer gain something in the exchange. Whereas companies receive data they can use for marketing communications, the consumer gains some sort of content that has an incentive. We'll discuss this in greater detail later.

The typical conversion path for a lead magnet contains the following:

* **Call to Action (CTA)** - this is a tagline and a button that encourages customers to act on the lead magnet offer
* **Landing page** - This is area where customers submit their information. This area can be combined withe the CTA (as done in my CTA below)
* **Thank You Action** - Once the customer submits his or her information, he or she will be redirected to another landing page or receive a download or email containing the incentive. 

For creating such lead magnets, there are [dozens of popular third party tools](https://instapage.com/blog/landing-page-software). With some coding savvy, these can easily be created on websites as well.

## What are common types of lead magnets?

### App/Tool Permission

Look at all of the apps on your phone. How many of them have you had to provide at least an email to access? Most if not all of them. Mobile apps are a natural lead magnet. This is why Facebook and Twitter have some of the most robust amounts of data in the world.

### Exclusive Content

E-books. Cheat Sheets. Guides. Webinars. Podcasts. Resources. The list goes on and on. There are a million types of content that companies offer to generate new leads. The content that cannot be accessed elsewhere on the web is bound to get consumer's attention.

### Training

Companies frequently offer webinars that offer educational value, continuing education credit, and even certifications. By offering this content, companies can showcase products, inform customers, and generate new info for new leads.

### Exclusive Access

"Sign up to read the full article." How many times have you seen this? Exclusive access sections are frequently used to generate subscription revenue or at a minimum lead information. It's worth noting that this type of lead is not always a paywall. Many websites offer free tools, exclusive content, and other valuable features in these member's only areas.

### Free trial

This is your age old "7-day trial, if you don't like it you're aren't obligated to buy it" strategy. Customers get a free test run of a product, and the company gets relatively qualified lead data with an existing product. Companies must be careful not to give away full benefit of the product within the free trial timeframe. For example, I signed up for a thirty-day trial for Ancestry.com. For 30 days, I researched every one of my ancestors and exported all the data. Once the 30 days were up, I never used the product again.

### Discount

This is the exchange where someone subscribes to receive a monetary discount. For consumers this exchange of data for a discount is a great win and dollars saved. For marketers, this will generate many new leads, but they may not be interested in long-term engagement as I discussed in my article, "[7 Ways to Reduce Your Email Marketing Unsubscribe Rates](https://markdfleming.com/7-ways-to-reduce-your-email-marketing-unsubscribe-rates/ "7 Ways to Reduce Your Email Marketing Unsubscribe Rates")."

### Consultation

As a sister to the free trial, the free consultation is a great option for leads that are more qualified. These consumers submit information, and the company communications directly consults with the contact. Of all lead magnets, this personal option will lead to a high conversion rate, yet it is one of the most time-consuming options.

### Survey

Surveys can be used as a way for customers to submit profiles to the company or market research. In a research project I recently conducted, I shared a survey on social media and easily obtained several hundred names and emails. While I did not use this data for lead generation, many companies do. Just clearly communicate the intentions of the survey, how the data will be used, and how consumers can unsubscribe.

## What are the traits of a good lead magnet?

### Free

[Consumers are more skeptical of sharing their data]() than in years past, and they are savvy that lead magnets are designed to harvest information. With this in mind, companies should not charge money for lead magnets, if they are hoping to get a big return on lead generation. The hurdle of getting a consumer to not only share information but then pay for some sort of information may cause a magnet to fail.

### Exclusive / High Value

Lazy companies recycle publicly available content into a lead magnet. When consumers access this content or tool, this leads to an underwhelming experience. If consumers feel underwhelmed about the magnet, this may impact the perception of the company's brand and the likelihood that they convert to a sale. As so, ensure that lead magnets are truly exclusive and of high value.

### Functional

Lead magnets should aim to create a quick win. They need to solve a singular problem you have identified for your target market.
