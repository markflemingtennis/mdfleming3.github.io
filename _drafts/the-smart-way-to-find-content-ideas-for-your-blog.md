As discussed in [my article on the three stage content marketing life cycle](https://markdfleming.com/streamline-your-content-marketing-strategy-with-the-three-stage-lifecycle/ "my article on the three stage content marketing life cycle"), your company’s content strategy is always presenting new opportunities for high quality content. Unfortunately, most content fail to capitalize because they do not have S.M.A.R.T. ways for recognizing these opportunities. This ends up leading to either blasé content or ideas that are inconsistent with your blog's brand. Yawn! In this post, I will discuss what S.M.A.R.T. ways are out there and how they can help your identify hundreds of high ROI ideas in just minutes.

## What is the S.M.A.R.T. way for finding ideas?

Simply put, S.M.A.R.T. stands for the following:

* **S**urvey Your Customers
* **M**anage Your Feed
* **A**nalytics, Baby!
* **R**esearch your keywords for Ideas
* **T**rack all of your ideas with Google Sheets

## Survey Your Customers

Whenever you create content, you should remember that it's not about you, but its about your customers and readers. What do they want to know more about? What problems are they facing? What do you know that can help them and drive them to other products that you offer? To answer these questions, you should either engage with your customers or conduct a survey.

If you are you operating email campaigns or social campaigns, notice who is engaging with your content. The next time you talk with them or email them, ask them how they are enjoying the content. If you want to collect a larger litmus test, consider using a tool like [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/ "Survey Monkey") that can be easily integrated into many networks. This will allow you to attach numbers to your content.

## Manage Your Feed

## Analytics, Baby!

## Research your keywords for Ideas

## Track all of your ideas with Google Sheets
