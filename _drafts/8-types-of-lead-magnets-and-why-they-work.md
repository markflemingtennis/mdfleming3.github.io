## What is a lead magnet?

A lead magnet is an incentive given to potential customers for providing their contact information, such as name and email, through a company's website. This exchange works because both the company and the consumer gain something in the exchange.

The typical conversion path of a lead magnet looks like this:

* Call to Action (CTA) - this is a tagline and a button that encourages customers to act on the lead magnet offer
* Landing page - This is area where customers submit their information. This area can be combined withe the CTA (as done in my CTA below)
* Thank You Page or Email -

## What are common types of lead magnets?

### App/Tool Permission

Look at all of the apps on your phone. How many of them have you had to provide at least an email to access? Likely most if not all of them. Mobile apps are a natural lead magnet. This is why Facebook and Twitter have some of the most robust amounts of data in the world.

### Exclusive Content

E-books. Cheat Sheets. Guides. Webinars. Podcasts. Resources. The list goes on and on. There are a million types of content that companies offer to generate new leads. If it's useful to a customer or prospect, there is a way to generate a lead from content.

### Training

Companies frequently offer webinars that offer educational value, continuing education credits, and occasionally certifications. By offering this content, companies can showcase products, inform customers, and generate new contact information.

### Exclusive Access

"Sign up to read the full article." How many times have you seen this paywall? This is a type of exclusive access that is used to generate subscription revenue or at a minimum lead information. Not all exclusive access is a pesky paywall. Many websites offer free tools, exclusive content, and other valuable features in these member's only areas.

### Free trial

This is your age old "7-day trial, if you don't like it you're aren't obligated to buy it" strategy. Customers get a free test run of a product, and the company obtains data on a more qualified lead than one that simply accessed content. With this lead magnet, companies must be careful not to give away full benefit of the product within the free trial timeframe. For example, I once used a thirty-day trial for Ancestry.com. For 30 days, I researched every one of my ancestors and exported all the dat. Once the 30 days were up, I never used the product again.

### Discount

This is the exchange where someone subscribes to receive a monetary discount. For consumers this exchange of data for a discount is a great win and dollars saved. For marketers, this will generate many new leads, but they may not be long-lasting prospects as I discussed in my article, "[7 Ways to Reduce Your Email Marketing Unsubscribe Rates](https://markdfleming.com/7-ways-to-reduce-your-email-marketing-unsubscribe-rates/ "7 Ways to Reduce Your Email Marketing Unsubscribe Rates")."

### Consultation

As a sister to the free trial, the free consultation is a great option for leads that are more qualified. They submit their information, and a contact within the company communications with them on an issues. Of all the lead magnets, this personal option will lead to a high conversion rate, yet it is one of the most time-consuming options.

### Survey

Surveys can be used in many different ways. They can be used as a way for customers to submit a profile to the company, and they can be used for market research. In a research project I recently conducted, I shared a survey on social media and easily obtained several hundred names and emails. While I do not plan on using this data for lead generation, many companies do. Just make sure the contacts know this data will be used in the future.

## What are the traits of a good lead magnet?

### Free

[Consumers are more skeptical of sharing their data]() than in years past, and they are savvy that lead magnets are designed to harvest this information. With this in mind, companies should not charge money for lead magnets, if they are hoping to get a big return on lead generation. The hurdle of getting a consumer to not only share information but then pay for some sort of information may cause a magnet to fail.

Exclusive / High Value

Lazy companies tend to recycle publicly available information into a lead magnet. This leads to a disappointing user experience for customers who shared their data.
