Influencer marketing is expected to become a nearly $10 billion market this year with companies increasing influencer spends and creators coming of age. Despite this growth, many small businesses do not have effective practices in place for vetting influencers. This results in both companies and customers being fooled by creators that are not as popular as they may seem. For example, a study by CBS News claims that 15% of corporate dollars spent on influencer marketing is lost to targeting fake followers. To avoid such fraud, I have assembled metrics you should consider to determine the authenticity of an Instagram influencer.

## Abnormal Historical Growth / Engagement

[Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/ "Social Blade") is my favorite FREE tool for determining if an influencer is legitimate. Its most powerful feature is its ability to see historical insights from a social media account. As compared to seeing a simple metric like engagement rate, this digs deeper into the historical growth of an influencers account. You can correlate spikes in growth with certain actions. Let's look at [Roger Federer's](http://instagram.com/rogerfederer "Roger Federer Instagram") account.

Federer's account is consistently growing and his weekly growth is always positive with  occasional jumps in account growth. Since there are no abnormalities in this traffic, this is a portrait of a healthy legitimate account. This makes sense because Federer is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world with many endorsements; manipulating his following on instagram wouldn't make sense.

On the other hand, let's look at an account with abnormal traffic. I stumbled across an account that was affiliated with one of the largest influencer marketing agencies. When I dug into the traffic, I noticed several red flags.
