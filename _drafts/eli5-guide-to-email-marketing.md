Alongside social media, SEM, content marketing, and SEO--email marketing is one of the cornerstones of digital marketing. However, many marketers find email marketing to be one of the more complicated marketing practices. Sending to several thousand recipients can feel like your finger is on the nuclear button, which is further escalated if you don't know what you are doing. As so, in this “Explain like I am Five” (ELI5) Guide, I will explain everything you need to know to get started with building an email marketing campaign.

## What is Email Marketing?

Email marketing is the act of sending automated or mass distributed email content to customers and/or clients who have opt-in to receiving content directly from the company. In comparison to other forms of digital marketing, email is useful because it is:

* **Direct** - It is frequently more engaged with than other forms of marketing
* **Automated** - it can replace the efforts of salespeople
* **Affordable** - email is one of the cheapest way to send customized messages to thousands of contacts
* **Data-driven** - email is a behemoth for collecting customer data; many companies are building new business simply through email automation

As we take a deep dive into the practice, let's break down email marketing into four types of actions that will compose your email marketing strategy.

* **Content Management**
* **Data Management**
* **Engagement**
* **Performance Analysis**

In this guide, we will dissect each of these buckets.

## Content Management

This section is focused on the content within the email. If you have a content marketer, this will be the area where you feel most at home. While this includes your typical graphic design, copyrighting, template creation--this bucket also includes the logic behind your campaign.

### Email Content/Design

With popular email platforms like Mailchimp, Hubspot, and Constant Contact -- there are few limitations to what your email's design can look like. Many of these platforms come with templates that allow you to drag and drop graphics, photos, text, links, etc. Across platforms, reoccurring features within an email include:

* **Subject Line** - the title of your email
* **Preview** - the pre-header that shows in your email inbox
* **From Address** - the name and email the email is coming fox (i.e. Mark Fleming mark@markdfleming.com)
* **Email body** - this is the bread and butter of the email; where all the content lives

To improve workflow, the aforementioned platforms allow marketers to create email templates that can be reused or use HTML code to fully customize the type of layout. This means that you can create an email that looks like it's a professionally designed print flyer or you can keep the email as simple plain text. Both of these designs can be the better choice, depending on the scenario. In the A/B Testing section, we'll dig deeper into this.

While there is a lot to cover on the fundamentals of design, I won't go to in-depth in this guide (keep an eye out for future blog posts). However, here are some great articles on the matter:

### Types of Email Campaigns

Email marketing campaigns are broken into two distinct bins: manual and automated.

#### Manual Campaigns

For manual campaigns, these are similar to sending a regular email. You need draft and design content, enter that content into the email platform, select recipients, and send the email. While this process takes longer, it gives you greater control of the content you are distributing. In particular, manual campaigns are used when the content cannot be easily replicated. As so, emails such as nonrecurring event invitations and company announcements are common campaigns that are manually distributed.

#### Automated Campaigns and Drip Campaigns

Automated campaigns, on the other hand, are some of the most powerful functions performed by marketing departments. These are emails that are automatically sent to certain customers or prospects. They are typically the result of a trigger (which I discuss in more detail below). Automated campaigns are typically used when content is similar for all recipients, except for a few customized fields that a determined by merged fields (i.e. first name, order amount, location, etc.).

When a company builds an automated email campaign that uses logic or multiple emails in a sequence, this is called **drip campaigns**. Based on the actions a consumer takes, a company can send highly targeted emails that can help provide greater value to customers and streamline the sales cycle.

#### The Basics of Triggers

With automated email campaigns, they are not possible without triggers. Triggers are some sort of parameter that is used to segment a population. They help power automated emails and nurture sequences because, they allow contacts to meet said parameter in real time. An example of this would be "everyone who has opened an email in the last month." An email could be automated to every contact who fulfills this parameter. This is a basic trigger.

When sending automated emails, these parameters can be combined to create unique and highly engaged segments of an audience. Additionally, they can be used to power common types of automated emails such as purchases, new contact welcome emails, event registrations. All of this data will live inside a CRM system, which will lead to our next topic. 

## Data Management

### Data Collection in Email Marketing

A customer relationship management system (CRM) is a tool that allows companies to manage all relationships with customers. They are powerful tools that operate at the heart of many businesses and enable sales teams to be successful. Additionally, these tools are built in with your email provider (i.e. Hubspot) or connected through an integration (i.e. Marketo and Salesforce). This allows email marketing efforts to not only help marketing teams, but rather the entire company. 

With email marketing, the goal is ultimately to drive sales, but the data collected through email can inform product decisions. Whenever a customer engages with an email, most email software products will automatically collect actions such as opens, clicks, subscribes, unsubscribes, registrations, and many other pieces of data. These all will feed back into the company's CRM to help better shape customer personas.
