Search engine optimization – yes, that fancy phrase you’ve heard for years. You know it’s important, but do you really know how it works for your website and Google Search engine success? In this ELI5 guide (ELI5 = “Explain like I am 5”), I will explain everything you need to know to get started with SEO. My goal is for this guide to be a practical reference to help you better understand the jargon and marketing concepts used in this blog.

## **What is SEO?**

SEO is short for “search engine optimization.” This is a fancy word for the process of improving your webpage’s position on search results. With millions of results for every search engine query, SEO helps your page rank correctly and higher than your competitors. Unlike Search Engine Marketing campaigns (SEM) that involve managing paid advertisements, SEO is an “organic” or an unpaid process. This means that you cannot pay for a higher position; it is determined by playing by the search engine’s rules.

## **Why are search engine rankings important?**

Simply put, high position pages get a lot of more traffic than low position pages. More traffic = more sales and visibility.

To better understand the decay that occurs from high position pages to low position pages, let’s consider some research. In analyzing over 5 million SERPs, a Backlinko study found that:

* Top position results gets 31.7% of all clicks
* Top three position results get 75.1% of all clicks
* Second page results get only 0.78% of all clicks (Yikes!)

In another study, Ignite Visibility found that clickthrough rates (CTR) dramatically decreased depending on where a webpage was positioned.

* Position 1: 43.32%
* Position 2: 37.36%
* Position 3: 29.90%
* Position 4: 19.38%
* Position 5: 10.95%
* Position 6: 10%
* Position 7: 5.28%
* Position 8: 4.13%
* Position 9: 4.13%
* Position 10: 3.11%

In short, good search engine rankings have a huge impact on traffic! By understanding how these are calculated, you can have an upper hand on your competitors.

## **On-page SEO and Off-page SEO**

Now that we know what SEO is and why it’s important, you may be wondering: what factors influence SEO? Let’s lift the hood and look around.

SEO is separated into two buckets: On-page SEO and Off-Page SEO. On page-SEO consists of factors that occur _within your website’s code_. You have lots of control over these factors, and optimizing these factors will improve how users experience your website. On the other hand, Off-page SEO occurs _outside your website’s code_, where you have less control. This balance of highly controlled on-page SEO factors and uncontrolled off-page SEO factors check and balance one another. If your strategy does not consider both of these categories, your website will not earn a top position for highly accessed keywords.

## **On Page SEO Checklist:**

### **Content**

#### Title Tag

A title tag is the title of the page. It should hook users to the page, but it must be unique and descriptive of the page contents. Here are some key considerations:

* **Keywords:** By including the keyword that your article is about will help the search engine figure out what the page is about. For example, “20 Best Men’s Shoes for Hiking in 2020” gives a very good idea of what an article will be about.


* **Ideal length:** 50-60 characters. If a webpage is longer, Google will cut off the article (i.e. “List of Disney theatrical animated features | Disney Wiki ...”).


* **Branding:** Many websites include branding at the end of their title tag. This helps improve your branding, but it also helps rank the page for search queries related to your brand.


* **Avoid boilerplate titles:** These are titles

#### Meta Description

A meta description is the description of the page. Think of this as a description of your page in one sentence. Here are some key considerations:

* **Keywords:** Like title tags, strategically use the keywords you want to target here, but also make sure they appear within the body of the page.


* **Ideal Length:** 150-300 characters.

It should be unique and describe the contents of the page. This is

**Every web page should have a unique title that describes that page**

\*_Remember!_* On-page = within your website; high control.

Here are some very important factors:

**Crawlability:**

Once I had a boss notice a webpage was still appearing on Google that shouldn’t be. The boss said, “Give those folks at Google a call and tell them to take that page down this instant.” I said, “Uh, that’s not how it works.” The boss said, “Well, how does it work?”

In a nutshell, there are two files that websites must have to interact with search engines. The first is a robots.txt file. This tells the search engine if it can “crawl” the website for content. Without this little file, you will not appear on a Google or Bing. If you have a sensitive page within a website, robots.txt files can prevent these pages from being accessed.

The second page that is essential is a sitemap. This page expands on the robots.txt file. Its job is to inform search engine crawlers of new content that is added. This is how your new pages appear on Google.

Security – using “HTTPS”:

When

**URL Structure:**

URLs are easy to understand are much better than URLs that are not. If your URL has a lot of numbers or strings of text you do not understand, that is not good. Google prefers URLs that are simple and contain relevant information to what people are searching. Here is an ideal example:

[https://www.example.com/category-keyword/subcategory-keyword/primary-keyword](https://www.example.com/category-keyword/subcategory-keyword/primary-keyword "https://www.example.com/category-keyword/subcategory-keyword/primary-keyword")

**Mobile-Friendly:**

At the time this article was published, over 50% of internet users are using mobile phones. Those numbers are consistent with the traffic I have noticed with this website. Google’s algorithm gives preference to websites that have mobile-friendly websites. To test if your website is mobile friendly, use \[Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test\]( [https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly "https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly"))
