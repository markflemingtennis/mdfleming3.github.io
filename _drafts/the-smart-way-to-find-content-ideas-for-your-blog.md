As discussed in [my article on the three stage content marketing lifecycle](https://markdfleming.com/streamline-your-content-marketing-strategy-with-the-three-stage-lifecycle/ "my article on the three stage content marketing lifecycle"), your company’s content strategy is always presenting new opportunities for high quality content. Unfortunately, most content creators fail to capitalize because they do not have S.M.A.R.T. ways for recognizing these opportunities. This ends up leading to either blasé content or ideas that are inconsistent with your blog's brand. Yuck! In this post, I will discuss what S.M.A.R.T. ways are out there and how they can help you find hundreds of high ROI ideas in just minutes.

## What is the S.M.A.R.T. way for finding ideas?

Simply put, S.M.A.R.T. stands for the following:

* **S**urvey Your Customers
* **M**anage Your Feed
* **A**nalytics, Baby!
* **R**esearch your keywords for Ideas
* **T**rack all of your ideas with Google Sheets

## Survey Your Customers

This is the good old fashioned way of asking your customers what they want to read. It's easy, but effective. That's because the content you create should not be about you, but all about your customers. What do they want to know more about? What problems are they facing? How can your products help them out? By asking your customer these questions in person or through a survey, you will get great ideas first hand from the people that matter most.

To do this, track who is engaging with your content in email, social, or through your website, etc. The next time you interact with these readers, ask them what they have enjoyed about the blog and what they want to know more about. If you want to collect a larger litmus test, consider using a tools like [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/ "Google Forms") or [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/ "Survey Monkey"). 

## Manage Your Feed

There are dozens of RSS Reader apps on the internet; I prefer [Feedly](https://feedly.com/ "Feedly"). These feeds are powerful because they allow you to directly collect daily content from websites and news sources. These are great if you want to consolidate all your news sources instead of slogging through Linkedin or Facebook. These feeds are even better if you want to streamline your competitive analysis.

By incorporating all your business competitors as well as SEO competitors (those who are taking the top spot from you on target keywords), you can funnel all competitor content into one place. This is highly useful for identifying what your competitors are covering and how you can create content that one-ups them.

## Analytics, Baby!

I have worked with many business leaders that are impressed with 

## Research your keywords for Ideas

Keyword research is the process of finding keywords that will help your web page rank higher. This tactic can be helpful for developing ideas because it gives the content creator insight into how searchers and potential readers are searching for content. Keyword can also help you find niche topics that are related to your content, but not necessarily

With tools like Google Keyword Planner and Ubersuggest, content writers can discover similar keywords and search volume for the ideas in which they are interested.

## Track all of your ideas with Google Sheets
