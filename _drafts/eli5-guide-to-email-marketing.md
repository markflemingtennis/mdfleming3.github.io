In this “Explain like I am Five” (ELI5) Guide, I will explain everything you need to know to build the foundations of a good email marketing strategy.

## What is Email Marketing?

Email marketing is the act of sending automated or mass distributed email content to customers and/or clients who have chosen to opt-in to receiving content directly from the company. In comparison to other forms of digital marketing, email is useful because it is:

* **Direct** - It is frequently more engaged with than other forms of marketing
* **Automated** - it can replace the efforts of salespeople
* **Affordable** - email is one of the cheapest way to send customized messages to thousands of contacts
* **Data-driving** - email is a behemoth for collecting customer data; many companies are building new business simply through email automation

While some executives think email marketing is simply just sending emails to clients, it's a little more complicated than that. I like to segment email marketing/marketing automation into four separate actions that are running at the same time:

* **Sending Content**
* **Driving Action**
* **Measuring Results**
* **Managing Data**

In this guide, we will dissect each of these buckets.

## Sending Content

### Email Design

With popular email platforms like Mailchimp, Hubspot, and Constant Contact -- there are few limitations to what your email's design can look like. Many of these platforms come with templates that allow you to drag and drop graphics, photos, text, links, etc. Across platforms, reoccurring features within an email include:

* **Subject Line** - the title of your email
* **Preview** - the pre-header that shows in your email inbox
* **From Address** - the name and email the email is coming fox (i.e. Mark Fleming mark@markdfleming.com)
* **Email body** - this is the bread and butter of the email; where all the content lives

To improve workflow, the aforementioned platforms allow marketers to create email templates that can be reused or use HTML code to fully customize the type of layout. This means that you can create an email that looks like it's a professionally designed print flyer or you can keep the email as simple plain text. Both of these designs can be the better choice, depending on the scenario. In the A/B Testing section, we'll dig deeper into this.

While there is a lot to cover on the fundamentals of design, I won't go to in-depth in this guide (keep an eye out for future blog posts). However, here are some great articles on the matter:

### Types of Email Campaigns

Email marketing campaigns are broken into two distinct bins: manual and automated.

#### Manual Campaigns

For manual campaigns, these are similar to sending a regular email. You need draft and design content, enter that content into the email platform, select recipients, and send the email. While this process takes longer, it gives you greater control of the content you are distributing. In particular, manual campaigns are used when the content cannot be easily replicated. As so, emails such as nonrecurring event invitations and company announcements are common campaigns that are manually distributed.

#### Automated Campaigns and Drip Campaigns

Automated campaigns, on the other hand, are some of the most powerful functions performed by marketing departments. These are emails that are automatically sent to certain customers or prospects. They are typically the result of a trigger (which I discuss in more detail below). Automated campaigns are typically used when content is similar for all recipients, except for a few customized fields that a determined by merged fields (i.e. first name, order amount, location, etc.).

When a company builds an automated email campaign that uses logic or multiple emails in a sequence, this is called **drip campaigns**. Based on the actions a consumer takes, a company can send highly targeted emails that can help provide greater value to customers and streamline the sales cycle.

#### A Deeper Dive into Triggers

With automated email campaigns, they are not possible without triggers.

A trigger is a function in email marketing that causes emails to automatically send to clients based on the customer's action. That is, when a piece of data is collected

Triggers are important, because they are the foundation of building drip sequences.
