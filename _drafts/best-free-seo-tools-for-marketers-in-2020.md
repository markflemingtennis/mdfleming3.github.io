In my [ELI5 Guide to SEO](https://markdfleming.com/eli5-guide-search-engine-optimization-seo/ "ELI5 Guide to SEO"), I discussed the factors that are important to a businesses on-page and off-page performance. MarTech companies are constantly pitching software that can improve these tools to small businesses. While many of these tools are excellent, there are hundreds of powerful FREE tools on the internet that can optimize your SEO performance. I will highlight the tools that I feel are your best resource in 2020.

## On-Page SEO

### [Woorank](https://www.woorank.com/ "Woorank")

Woorank is an analysis tool that provides simple and easy to interpret analysis of your on-page SEO data. If you are looking for a macro view of your website's performance, I feel this is the definitive tool.

### [Browseo](https://www.browseo.net/ "Browseo")

Browseo is a no-frills program that shows you what data a search engine is collecting from a webpage. It is an excellent tool for competitive research and troubleshooting SEO for individual pages.

## Analytics

### [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/ "Google Analytics")

Google's flagship website tool that tracks everything you need to know. This is an essential tool. If you do not have this hooked up, you are not only missing out on valuable data, your SEO is likely penalized.

### [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about "Google Search Console")

Google Search Console allows webmasters to measure search traffic and performance, fix issues, and optimize indexing for webpages. Since this data directly impacts your search engine rank, this is another essential tool from Google.

### [SpyFu](https://www.spyfu.com/)

SpyFu is a competitive analysis that allows you to search for competitors websites, see their traffic, and download their keywords. This can quickly help you spy on competitors PPC strategy and SEO tactics.

### [SEOlyzer](https://seolyzer.io/ "SEOlyzer")

SEOlyzer is a tool that allows you to visualize and analyze log analysis and monitor SEO KPIs in real time. 

## Keyword Research:

### [Google Keyword Planner]( "Google Keyword Planner")

This tool is typically used for keyword research when running PPC campaigns, but it can be hugely useful for content writers looking for long-string keywords. Search for a keyword idea, and you will receive a list of related keywords with average monthly searches and level of competition. This can all be easily exported.
