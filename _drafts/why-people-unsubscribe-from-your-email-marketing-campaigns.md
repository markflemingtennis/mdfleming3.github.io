Anyone who has dipped their toes in email marketing understands that unsubscribes are a part of the business. However, it is deflating to see a once-promising lead unsubscribe from your campaign. When this happens, marketers are left scratching their heads and wondering what went wrong. That's where this framework comes in handy. It explains the motivations behind unsubscribes in an effort to help you create more engaging email marketing campaigns.

## Reasons for Subscribing

### Valuable Content

This is the most basic reason. People subscribe because they find a company's content to be educational, insightful, relevant, or even entertaining. Subscribing to receive this content is more economical than contacting a business representative, searching a company website, or scanning social media. The valuable content is free, direct, and accessible.

### Exclusive Value

Several weeks ago, I needed to buy a new pair of running shoes. I discovered that Dick's Sporting Goods has a deal where first-time mailing list subscribers receive a 20% off coupon. Great! I subscribed, got my coupon, and bought a pair of sneakers for a huge discount. It was an exclusive value that justified my decision to subscribe.

People subscribe to email campaigns to get something they cannot get elsewhere. Common types of this incentive include:

* App or paywall access (i.e. "submit your email address to download")
* Exclusive content or insights (i.e. white papers, guides, etc.)
* Membership or account creation
* Incentives (i.e. giveaways, coupons, discounts, etc.)

### Brand News and Announcements

If someone wants to know about a company's brand, receiving company email alerts is one method in the toolbox. These types of individuals could include clients, investors,  media members, and even competitors who are trying to stay updated with your company's happenings. This is essential to the business function, but it is a great opportunity for cross selling and building awareness for particular products and services.

## Reasons for Unsubscribing

### Too much Frequency

### Exclusive Value Obtained

### Lack of Overall Value or Relevancy
