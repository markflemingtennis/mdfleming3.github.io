Influencer marketing is expected to become a nearly $10 billion market this year with companies increasing influencer spends and creators coming of age. Despite this growth, many small businesses do not have effective practices in place for vetting influencers. This results in both companies and customers being fooled by creators that are not as popular as they may seem. For example, a study by CBS News claims that 15% of corporate dollars spent on influencer marketing is lost to targeting fake followers. To avoid such fraud, I have assembled metrics you should consider to determine the authenticity of an Instagram influencer.

## Abnormal Historical Growth / Engagement

Tools like [Social Blade](https://socialblade.com/ "Social Blade") can provide powerful insight into an Instagram account. Of all the metrics these tools can provide, you should first consider historical account growth and account engagement. This gives you a much more nuanced analysis than simply looking at the highly relative engagement rate.

## Declining Momentum

## Low Comment Quality

## Follow / Unfollow Method

## Inconsistency Across Platforms

## Low Engagement Rate

## Understanding Following and Reason for Popularity
