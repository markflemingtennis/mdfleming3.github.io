In this “Explain like I am Five” (ELI5) Guide, I will explain everything you need to know to build the foundations of a good email marketing strategy.

## What is Email Marketing?

Email marketing is the act of sending automated or mass distributed email content to customers and/or clients who have chosen to opt-in to receiving content directly from the company. In comparison to other forms of digital marketing, email is useful because it is:

* **Direct** - It is frequently more engaged with than other forms of marketing
* **Automated** - it can replace the efforts of salespeople
* **Affordable** - email is one of the cheapest way to send customized messages to thousands of contacts
* **Data-driving** - email is a behemoth for collecting customer data; many companies are building new business simply through email automation

While some executives think email marketing is simply just sending emails to clients, it's a little more complicated than that. I like to segment email marketing/marketing automation into four separate actions that are running at the same time:

* Sending Content
* Driving Action
* Measuring Results
* Managing Data

In this guide, we will dissect each of these buckets.
